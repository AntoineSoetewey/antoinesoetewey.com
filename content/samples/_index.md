{{< /lead >}}

This section contains some demo pages that show how Congo renders different types of content. You can also see an example [taxonomy listing]({{< ref "tags" >}}) page.

_**Sidenote:** This page is just a standard Congo article listing and Hugo has been configured to generate a `samples` content type and display article summaries._
