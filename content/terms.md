## Disclosure policy

I make money on this website through affiliate programs. If you click an affiliate link or ad banner and buy the product, you help support this website because I will get a percentage of that sale.

What this means for you:

* I became an affiliate to earn revenue towards the costs of running and maintaining this website. Where I have direct control over which ads are served on this website I offer only products that are directly related to the topic of this website and products that a reader/subscriber would have a genuine interest in or need of.
* I do not and will not recommend a product just for the sake of making money.
* I do not let the compensation I receive influence the content, topics, posts, or opinions expressed on this website.
* I respect and value my readers too much to write anything other than my own genuine and objective opinions and advice.

Just like this website, my disclosure policy is a work in progress. As the revenue streams evolve, so will this page.
