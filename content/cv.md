## Summary

I am a postdoctoral researcher in statistics at HEC Liège and UCLouvain Saint-Louis Brussels, where I contribute to both the ODALON (Open multimodal Data for Automated LOcal News) and [Beamm](https://beamm.brussels/) (BElgian Arithmetic Microsimulation Model) projects. Before that, I obtained a PhD in statistics at UCLouvain, where my research focused on survival analysis and biostatistical methods applied to cancer patients.

In parallel with my [research](/research/), I [teach](/teaching/) statistics and probability at the undergraduate and master's levels as a visiting lecturer at UCLouvain and UNamur.
