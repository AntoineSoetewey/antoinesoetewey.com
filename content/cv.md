## Summary

I am a postdoctoral researcher in statistics at UCLouvain Saint-Louis Brussels and HEC Liège, where I contribute to the [Beamm](https://beamm.brussels/) project, which aims to develop a microsimulation model of the Belgian tax system. Before that, I obtained a PhD in statistics at UCLouvain, where my research focused on survival analysis and biostatistical methods applied to cancer patients.

In parallel with my [research](/research/), I [teach](/teaching/) statistics and probability at the undergraduate and master's levels as a visiting lecturer at UCLouvain and UNamur.
