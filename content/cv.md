## Summary

I am a PhD candidate in statistics at UCLouvain in Belgium, within the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences. My research interests focus on bio-statistical procedures applied to cancer patients.

In parallel with my doctoral thesis, I am teaching assistant for several courses in statistics and probability at bachelor and master’s level and I provide trainings and workshops in data science, statistics and R programming for UCLouvain’s technology platform for Statistical Methodology and Computing Service.

In my spare time, I write about statistics and code in R via my blog [statsandr.com](https://statsandr.com/).
