I am a PhD candidate in statistics at UCLouvain (Belgium) within the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences. My [research interests](/research/) focus on survival analysis and bio-statistical procedures applied to cancer patients.

In parallel with my doctoral thesis, I am [teaching assistant](/teaching/) for several courses in statistics and probability at bachelor and master's level. I also provide trainings/workshops and consulting in data science, statistics and R (an open source statistical software program) as part of UCLouvain's technology platform for Statistical Methodology and Computing Service. See more in my [CV](/cv/).

Given my experience, I also support:

- **Students** and academics in their studies through the success of their exam or the statistical part of their thesis, thanks to tailor-made courses and personalized support in statistics and probability. See more information at [easystat.be](https://easystat.be/).
- **Professionals** and companies in their research, data analysis and informed decision-making by bringing a statistical dimension to their projects, regardless of the sector, core business or size of the company. See more information at [datanalyze.be](https://datanalyze.be/).

If you need help in statistics, data analysis or R for your academic or work related projects, feel free to contact me via the corresponding website!

In my spare time I like to play sports, learn to [code](/software/) and write about statistics and its applications in R through my [blog](https://statsandr.com/). I also enjoy reading nonfiction [books](/files/booklist.html) on statistics, (behavioral) economics, management/personal finance or psychology and [traveling](/files/visited-places.html) around the globe.

Do not hesitate to [contact me](/contact/) if you have any questions or inquiries.
