title: About
---

I am a postdoctoral researcher in statistics at HEC Liège and UCLouvain Saint-Louis Brussels. I contribute to the ODALON (Open multimodal Data for Automated LOcal News) project, which leverages data science to enhance journalism and enable the partial automation of local news, and the [Beamm](https://beamm.brussels/) (Belgian Arithmetic Microsimulation Model) project, which focuses on economic policy simulation.

Before that, I obtained a PhD in statistics from UCLouvain, focusing on survival analysis and the implementation of biostatistical methods applied to cancer patients. I also hold a Master in Economics from KU Leuven and a Master in Econometrics from Maastricht University.

My [research interests](/research/) include (bio)statistics, data science, and the development of methods to analyze complex datasets. Passionate about making statistics accessible to everyone, I leverage open-source statistical programming languages like R to democratize the use and understanding of statistical tools.

In parallel with my research, I [teach](/teaching/) statistics and probability at the undergraduate and master's levels as visiting lecturer at UCLouvain and UNamur.

In my free time, I code in R, write about topics related to statistics and their applications, and share these resources on my [blog](https://statsandr.com/) to make them accessible and easy to understand.

I also enjoy sports, reading books on statistics, (behavioral) economics, personal finance/management, and psychology, as well as traveling around the world.

Feel free to [contact me](/contact/) if you have any questions.
