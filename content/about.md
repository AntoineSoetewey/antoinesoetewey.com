---

I am a postdoctoral researcher in statistics at UCLouvain Saint-Louis Brussels and HEC Liège. I contribute to the [Beamm](https://beamm.brussels/) (Belgian Arithmetic Microsimulation Model) project, which focuses on economic policy simulation, and the ODALON (Open multimodal Data for Automated Local News) project, which leverages data science to enhance journalism and enable the partial automation of local news.

Before that, I obtained a PhD in statistics from UCLouvain, focusing on survival analysis and the implementation of biostatistical methods applied to cancer patients. I also hold a Master in Economics from KU Leuven and a Master in Econometrics from Maastricht University.

My [research interests](/research/) include (bio)statistics, data science, and the development of methods to analyze complex datasets. Passionate about making statistics accessible to everyone, I leverage open-source statistical programming languages like R to democratize the use and understanding of statistical tools.

In parallel with my research, I [teach](/teaching/) statistics and probability at the undergraduate and master's levels as visiting lecturer at UCLouvain and UNamur.

<!--Given my experience, I also support:

- **Students and researchers** in their studies or the statistical part of their thesis or research project, thanks to tailor-made courses and personalized support in statistics and probability. See more information at [easystat.be](https://easystat.be/) *(website in French)*.
- **Professionals and companies** in their research, data analysis and informed decision-making by bringing a statistical dimension to their projects, regardless of the sector, core business or size of the company. See more information at [datanalyze.be](https://datanalyze.be/).

If you need help in statistics, data analysis or R, feel free to contact me via the corresponding website!-->

In my free time, I code in R, write about topics related to statistics and their applications, and share these resources on my [blog](https://statsandr.com/) to make them accessible and easy to understand.

I also enjoy sports, reading books on statistics, (behavioral) economics, personal finance/management, and psychology, as well as traveling around the world.

Feel free to [contact me](/contact/) if you have any questions.
