I am a postdoctoral researcher in statistics at UCLouvain Saint-Louis Brussels and HEC Liège, where I contribute to both the [Beamm](https://beamm.brussels/) (BElgian Arithmetic Microsimulation Model) and ODALON (Open multimodal Data for Automated Local News) projects. Before that, I obtained a PhD in statistics at UCLouvain, where my research focused on survival analysis and biostatistical methods applied to cancer patients.

In parallel with my [research](/research/), I [teach](/teaching/) statistics and probability at the undergraduate and master's levels as a visiting lecturer at UCLouvain and UNamur.

<!--Given my experience, I also support:

- **Students and researchers** in their studies or the statistical part of their thesis or research project, thanks to tailor-made courses and personalized support in statistics and probability. See more information at [easystat.be](https://easystat.be/) *(website in French)*.
- **Professionals and companies** in their research, data analysis and informed decision-making by bringing a statistical dimension to their projects, regardless of the sector, core business or size of the company. See more information at [datanalyze.be](https://datanalyze.be/).

If you need help in statistics, data analysis or R, feel free to contact me via the corresponding website!-->

In my free time, I code in R, write about topics related to statistics and their applications, and share these resources on my [blog](https://statsandr.com/) to make them accessible and easy to understand.

I also enjoy sports, reading books on statistics, (behavioral) economics, personal finance/management, and psychology, as well as traveling around the world.

Feel free to [contact me](/contact/) if you have any questions.
