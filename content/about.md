I am a PhD student in statistics at UCLouvain (Belgium) within the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences. My research interests focus on survival analysis and bio-statistical procedures applied to cancer patients. More information can be found in my <a href="/research/">research projects</a>.

In parallel with my doctoral thesis, I am <a href="/teaching/">teaching assistant</a> for several courses in statistics and probability at bachelor and master's level. I also provide trainings/workshops and consulting in statistics and R (an open source statistical software program) as part of UCLouvain's technology platform for Statistical Methodology and Computing Service. See more in my <a href="/cv.pdf">CV</a>.

Given my experience, I also support:

* **Professionals** in their research, data analysis and informed decision-making by bringing a statistical dimension to their projects, regardless of the sector or core business.
* **University students** and academics in their studies through the success of their exam or the statistical part of their thesis, thanks to tailor-made courses and personalized support in statistics and probability.

If you need help in statistics for your academic or work related projects, see more information on <a href="https://easystat.be/">easystat.be</a> and feel free to contact me!

<!--Prior to this PhD, I graduated in 2015 with a Master in Economics from KU Leuven and in 2016 with a Master in Econometrics from Maastricht University. You may see my <a href="/cv/">CV</a> to have a better overview of my academic and professional background.

In May 2015, I became an international tennis chair umpire (White Badge certification). Since then, I am fortunate enough to work regularly as a chair or line umpire on major tennis events across the world. This position allows me to develop leadership and teamwork skills, and a strong communication thanks to the guidance of internationally certified umpires.-->

In my spare time I like to play sports, learn to <a href="/software/">code</a> and write about statistics and its applications in R through my <a href="https://statsandr.com/">blog</a>. I also enjoy reading nonfiction <a href="/files/booklist.html">books</a> on statistics, (behavioral) economics, management/personal finance or psychology and <a href="/files/visited-places.html">traveling</a> around the globe.

Do not hesitate to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> if you have any questions or inquiries.
