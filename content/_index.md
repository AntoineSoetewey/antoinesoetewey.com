Hello, my name is Antoine Soetewey. I am a PhD researcher in statistics at UCLouvain, passionate about statistics and its multiple applications in the real world.

<!---
I am particularly interested in the popularization and democratization of statistics (and its applications in R) in order to make them accessible to everyone.

In parallel with my [research](/research/), which constitutes the core of my PhD thesis, I am [teaching](/teaching/) several courses in statistics, probability and data science at UCLouvain and UNamur. I also help professionals and companies to [analyze their data](https://datanalyze.be/), and I give [private lessons](https://easystat.be/) to students and researchers.

When I find the time, I code in R and share it on my [blog](https://statsandr.com/).
