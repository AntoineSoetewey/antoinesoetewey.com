Hello, my name is Antoine Soetewey. I am a PhD candidate in statistics at UCLouvain, passionate about statistics and its multiple applications in the real world.

Enjoying sharing my skills with others, I am [teaching](/teaching/) assistant for several courses in statistics, probability and data science. I also help professionals and companies to [analyze their data](https://datanalyze.be/), and I give [private lessons](https://easystat.be/) to students and researchers. This is in parallel with my [research](/research/), which constitutes the core of my PhD thesis.

When I find the time, I [code](/software/) in R and share it on my [blog](https://statsandr.com/).
