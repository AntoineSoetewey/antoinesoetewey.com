## Documentation

Congo has [extensive documentation](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/) that covers all aspects of the theme. Be sure to [read the docs](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/) to learn more about how to use the theme and its features.

## Installation

Congo supports several installation methods - as a Hugo Module (easiest), a git submodule, or as a completely manual install.

Detailed instructions for each method can be found in the [Installation](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/installation) docs. You should consult the documentation for the simplest setup experience. Below is a quick start guide using Hugo modules if you're already confident installing Hugo themes.

### Quick start using Hugo

> **Note:** Ensure you have **Go** and **Hugo** installed, and that you have created a new Hugo project before proceeding.

1. From your project directory, initialise Hugo Modules:

   ```shell
   hugo mod init github.com/<username>/<repo-name>
   ```

2. Create `config/_default/module.toml` and add the following:

   ```toml
   [[imports]]
   path = "github.com/jpanther/congo"
   ```

3. Start your server using `hugo server` and the theme will be downloaded automatically.

4. In the root folder of your website, delete the `config.toml` file that was generated by Hugo. Copy the `*.toml` config files from the theme into your `config/_default/` folder.

   > **Note:** Do not overwrite the `module.toml` file you created above!

   You will find these theme config files in the Hugo cache directory, or [download a copy](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/jpanther/congo/tree/stable/config/_default) from GitHub.

5. Follow the [Getting Started](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/getting-started/) instructions to configure your website.

### Installing theme updates

As new releases are posted, you can update the theme using Hugo. Simply run `hugo mod get -u` from your project directory and the theme will automatically update to the latest release.

Detailed [update instructions](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/installation/#installing-updates) are available in the docs.
