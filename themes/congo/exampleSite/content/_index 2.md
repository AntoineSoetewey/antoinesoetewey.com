A powerful, lightweight theme for Hugo built with Tailwind CSS.

This is a demo site built entirely using Congo. It also contains a complete set of [theme documentation]({{< ref "docs" >}}). Congo is flexible and is great for both static page-based content (like this demo) or a traditional blog with a feed of recent posts.
