          - reproducible using the latest stable release of the theme
          - not due to the local Hugo cache being out of date (run `hugo mod clean` to clear the cache)
          - not already covered by an open issue ([check open issues](https://github.com/jpanther/congo/issues))
          - not a general question or feature request (use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jpanther/congo/discussions) instead)
